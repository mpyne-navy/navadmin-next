# Description

Just some ideas of what modern NAVADMIN record messages might look like.

Still missing:

* Topics/categories
* Linking to official instructions (as opposed to normal hyperlinks)
* Testing various styles of tables to see what looks best on paper

# Example

1. A reformatted [NAVADMIN 059/19](NAVADMIN/2019/059.md)
2. Perhaps more useful, a reformatted [NAVADMIN 080/20](NAVADMIN/2020/080.md)
